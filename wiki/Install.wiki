= System Requirements =

== Operating System ==

First of all, don't even try to use this plug-in, if you don't have <b>Windows 7</b>. 
That being said, I didn't test it on beta or RC versions of Windows 7, but others have, and it's "working". It's meant to be used with the RTM version, build 7600. 

== Winamp ==

Some of the functions used require Winamp 5.x+, but I did not test it on older versions. I recommend using the latest version.

== Hardware ==

The plug-in itself doesn't require extra resources, but some of the features require Aero Peek enabled, which on it's turn requires a decent GPU. 

= Installation =

The NSIS installer takes care of everything, just run it. It will close Winamp, copy the plug-in to the detected Winamp folder, replaces the old one if necessary, and restarts Winamp. You can delete the installer after it's finished.

= Configuration =

You can access the plug-in configuration via the <b>Winamp Preferences -> Plug-ins -> General Purpose -> Windows 7 Taskbar Integration</b>
