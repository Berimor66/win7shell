#summary Future development plans for the plug-in

= What now? =

Well, people still want new features and fixes, and they could be implemented, but I don't really have time for all. I'm doing what I can, but I could use some help. The code is messy, I didn't really organized it form the start, and it's not commented, but if you think you can create a few classes in C++ (for example using an ID3v2 tag reader lib to extract embedded album art), let me now.

<b>
 * Improving translation support: Winamp has an official way for the translation system, I didn't figure it out yet.
 * Extracting embedded album art from the ID3v2 tag
 * Fixing jump list (maybe improve it to have tasks instead of file links)
 * Re-organizing code?
 * Implementing tiny features people suggest :<
