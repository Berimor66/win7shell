= What now? =

The plug-in development has come to a point where all the Win7 API was implemented, which was the main goal, and it's working fine (?). I think I will slow down with it, and just change some features, polish it a bit, etc. The main goal now is to get more translations

Check if the plug-in is translated into your native language, if not, create one yourself :D
You can translate both the plug-in and the installer.
