= Buy me a beer, if you like this plug-in =

<br />

|| Hello, my name is Atti, and I am the primary developer of this plug-in. <br>*Please sacrifice 2 minutes of your precious time*, as I've sacrificed <br>hundreds of sleepless hours to create this for you, since I started it <br>more than two years ago, *and read this page :)*. Here is a picture of <br>me basking in sunlight, so you have an idea who is talking to you. || http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3568892/me.jpg ||
|| http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3568892/Pictures/mountain_h.jpg || This is also me on this year's mountain trip. I'm a bit shy.<br> You have nothing (except pennies) to lose, so make me <br>(and you) happy by trading some of these pennies for *good<br>feelings*; after all, that's what they're for, right? Right. <br>Because we both deserve it! Every little counts a lot :). ||

<br />

== Why you should buy me a beer :-) ==

 * Because beer is good, and a "temporary solution" to everything
 * To thank me for working hard for free to create this plug-in
 * To support open-source software development (free = good)
 * To assist with continuing development
 * You're a good person who values the effort of other people
 * Because I will write your name on a shiny thank you list (if you want)
 * Because I will give you a hug of appreciation

== Why you should not buy me a beer :-( ==

 * Because you don't have money (I understand, thanks for reading)
 * Because you're lazy to spend 5 minutes on this
 * Because you're cheap
 * You don't like the plug-in :(
 * You don't appreciate free work

<br />

All jokes aside, I really do ask only for something small, something that isn't a big deal for you. Unfortunately many of you don't live in my area, and you can't buy me an actual beer, so I've set up a (completely secure) PayPal account where you can "donate a beer" to show your support. I will be extremely grateful.
