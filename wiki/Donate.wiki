= Buy me a beer, if you like this plug-in =

<br />

|| Hello, my name is Atti, and I am the primary developer of this plug-in. *Please sacrifice 2 minutes of your precious time*, as I've sacrificed hundreds of sleepless hours to create this for you, since I started it almost two years ago, *and read this page :)*. Here is a picture of me basking in sunlight, so you have an idea who is talking to you. || http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3568892/me.jpg ||

<br />

== Why you should buy me a beer ==

 * Because beer is good, and a "temporary solution" to everything
 * To thank me for working hard for free to create this plug-in
 * To support open-source software development (free = good)
 * To assist with continuing development
 * You're a good person who values the effort of other people
 * Because I will write your name on a thank you list (if you want)

== Why you should not buy me a beer ==

 * Because you don't have money (I understand)
 * Because you're lazy to spend 5 minutes on this
 * Because you're cheap
 * You don't like the plug-in :(
 * You don't appreciate free work

<br />

All jokes aside, I really do ask only for something small, something that isn't a big deal for you. Unfortunately many of you don't live in my area, and you can't buy me an actual beer, so I've set up a PayPal account where you can "donate a beer" to show your support. I will be extremely grateful.
