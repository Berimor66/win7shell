= Using Translations =

You can use only one translation at a time. If you want to change it, you replace the translation file with the new one. The file is located in the Winamp settings folder.

To open the folder, navigate to <b>%appdata%\Winamp\Plugins</b>. You can open start menu, select Run (Winkey + R) and type <b>%appdata%\Winamp\Plugins</b> to open it. 

Make sure the file's name is <b>win7shell.lng</b>.
Restart Winamp for the changes to take effect.

<i>The translation system might not be perfect, but I didn't have much time to work on it, and I'm out of country for some time.</i>
