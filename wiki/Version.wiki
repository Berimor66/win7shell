Added option to activate (somewhat) smoother text scrolling, and drawing in general > more CPU usage.
Improvement: Rating drawing is like on Bento skin, the missing stars till 5 are "padded" with bulbs, ex: ★ ★ ★ ● ●.
Album art is not forced to square anymore, it keeps aspect ratio.
Fixed some of the Winamp exit crashes / hangs, and some other minor ones...
