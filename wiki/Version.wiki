Fixed some reported bugs, updated translations.
Settings are now read correctly if you have Unicode characters in your Windows user name.
Jump list tasks won't open other players when Winamp is closed.
Added new task: "Resume Playback". When Winamp is closed, use this to resume playing the last song, from the same position as when you closed it.

1.00:
Album art is read from embedded picture from ID3v2 tag
Album art is drawn with MUCH higher quality
You can select what to use as background, if selected is not available
Jump list is configurable by categories

!!! PLEASE, READ THESE: !!! 
If you had Winamp pinned to the taskbar, remove the old icon, and pin the new one 
Winamp needs to be set to handle your music/video files in order to make use of the recent and frequent categories of the jump list.
I need more translations! :)
