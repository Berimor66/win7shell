Added new task: 'Play from beginning' - It will start Winamp if needed, and play the current playlist from the start
Fixed SHITLOADS of reported and recently discovered bugs (lazy to write details)
2 new lines in translations 

1.00:
Album art is read from embedded picture from ID3v2 tag
Album art is drawn with MUCH higher quality
You can select what to use as background, if selected is not available
Jump list is configurable by categories

!!! PLEASE, READ THESE: !!! 
If you had Winamp pinned to the taskbar, remove the old icon, and pin the new one 
Winamp needs to be set to handle your music/video files in order to make use of the recent and frequent categories of the jump list.
I need more translations! :)
