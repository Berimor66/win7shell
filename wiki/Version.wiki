Album art is read from embedded picture from ID3v2 tag
Album art is drawn with clearly noticeable MUCH higher quality
You can select what to use as background, if selected is not available
Jump list is configurable by categories
Bugfix: Didn't update title and artist while stream was playing
6 new lines in translations

!!! PLEASE, READ THESE: !!! 

If you had Winamp pinned to the taskbar, remove the old icon, and pin the new one (pin the icon, not the .exe), otherwise you will have 2 icons on the taskbar
Winamp needs to be set to handle your music/video files in order to make use of the recent and frequent categories of the jump list. It doesn't have to be the default player.

I need more translations! :)
