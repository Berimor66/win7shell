Fixed an important and old memory leak (it caused several other bugs, especially if you didn't restart Winamp for a long time).
Corrected icon order in the jump list.
Fixed several text formatting bugs, such as the shadow being sometimes one character short.
Added two more text formatting flags: %s% for shadow, and %b% for a translucent background for the text.
Fixed right-to-left support.
