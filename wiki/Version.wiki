Volume can be controlled using mouse wheel scroll when hovering over the Winamp icon on the taskbar.
Album art is taken directly from Winamp, so everything that is supported there, is used as aero peek background.
Longer text lines will scroll on the aero peek window.
Added text formatting flag: %d% to prevent that specific line from scrolling, even if it's longer than the width of the thumbnail window.
Added "Apply" button to immediately see the effects of the settings.
Some albums that had characters that are not allowed to be in a file name weren't loaded. It's fixed now.
