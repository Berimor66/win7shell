* Volume can be controlled using mouse wheel scroll when hovering over the Winamp icon on the taskbar.
* Album art is taken directly from Winamp, so everything that is supported there, is used as aero peek background.
* Longer text lines will scroll on the aero peek window.
* Added text formatting flag: %d% to prevent that specific line from scrolling, even if it's longer than the width of the thumbnail window.
* Added "Apply" button to immediately see the effects of the settings.
* "Favorite" button now opens a little window, where you can set a rating for the song from 0 to 5
* Some albums that had characters that are not allowed to be in a file name weren't loaded. It's fixed now.
